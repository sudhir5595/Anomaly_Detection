# Anomaly_Detection
In this project we are going to detect anomalies. Footage or data that we are using will be of stationary camera mounted at pedestrian walkways.The crowd density in the walkways was variable, ranging from sparse to very crowded. Abnormal crowd event can be classified into two groups on the basis of a scale of interest: global anomalous event and local anomalous event. The global anomalous event (GAE) concentrates on deciding if the whole scene is abnormal or not, whereas the local anomalous event (LAE) determines the regions where the abnormal event is happening within the scene.

In this project we are trying to detect LAE from the video.
